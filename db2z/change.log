Modified createTableInClause rule to allow for requested syntax...

CREATE TABLE [...]
(NOT? VOLATILE)? IN databaseName? tablespaceName

...which is not documented as far back as DB2 9, and I could not locate 
documentation for versions of DB2 prior to that.  So I'm presuming this is
old syntax, old enough that IBM no longer documents it, but not so old that
IBM doesn't allow for it.  Sort of like the SEP parameter of the JCL DD
statement.

Added testdata/sql_createTableCustomVolatile to test this.

--2022-06-02--------------------------------------------------------------------
Added scalar functions

AI_ANALOGY
AI_SEMANTIC_CLUSTER
AI_SIMILARITY

...and their syntax to DB2zSQLLexer.g4 and DB2zSQLParser.g4.

Added testdata/sql_aiFunction to test these.

## Mainframe Application Portfolio Analysis

The intent is to create at least part of what I would have wanted when I was being paid to be a mainframe application development tools person.

I was often asked application impact analysis questions, what runs, how often, which program calls which other programs, et. al.

My hope is to create a COBOL "call tree" tool, extracting CALLs, EXEC CICS LINKs, EXEC CICS XCTLs, EXEC SQL CALLs, and so forth to help give an idea of the "shape" of an application portfolio via static code analysis.

I'd like to do something analagous with JCL.

There certainly exist commercial products that do this, but they're pricey.  Maybe what I can do for free is good enough.

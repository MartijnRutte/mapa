The ./local directory has things I coded myself to test specific functions.  There is a -unitTest switch to check that these parse correctly.  The ./nist directory has most of the NIST compiler test suite, I did have to modify SQ225A, SQ226A, SQ227A, and SQ228A because they used the incorrect RECORD-KEY construct instead of RECORD KEY (without the hyphen).  I also removed some members that are simply too convoluted for me to bother with at this time: IX206A, NC205A, NC215A, NC401M, SM101A, SM206A, SM208A, SQ401M.  Maybe I'll come back around and deal with them.  Maybe not, I'm getting old.

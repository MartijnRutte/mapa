--2022-05-20--------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified CobolLexer and CobolParser per draft 202x Environment Division
specifications.

Added characterClassificationClause to Object-Computer paragraph.  Added
testdata/local/test9035.cbl.

Modified alphabetClauseFormat1; added localeClause,
dynamicLengthStructureClause, orderTableClause to Special-Names paragraph.

Added testdata/local/test9036.cbl.

--2022-05-18--------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified CobolLexer and CobolParser per draft 202x Identification Division
specifications.  Added Class-ID, Function-ID, Factory, Method-ID, Interface-ID,
Object, and Options paragraphs.

Further modification to functionCall to make the paren-args-paren construct
merely optional instead of allowing 0..n of them.

Also fixed tableCall rule to require subscripting, as otherwise it's not really
a tableCall.  It was also confusing recognition of singleton identifiers and
messing with my logic to resolve CALL IDENTIFIER statements.

Output file has two new record types, one for FUNCTION and one for CLASS.  The
rest of the fields mimic those for PGM.

--2022-05-16--------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified both lexers to understand floating literal continuations and
TheCLI.writeOutTerminalNodes() to process them correctly.  Added literal types
BX, NX, U, and UX.  Test cases testantlr?64.cbl added.

This is per the draft COBOL 202x standard.

--2022-05-14--------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified  CobolPreprocessorLexer.g4 and CobolPreprocessorParser.g4 to understand
draft COBOL 202x new compiler directives...

CALL-CONVENTION
COBOL-WORDS
DISPLAY
FLAG-02
FLAG-14
LEAP-SECOND
LISTING
PAGE
POP
PROPOGATE
PUSH
REF-MOD-ZERO-LENGTH
SOURCE FORMAT
TURN

...and added test9029.cbl to verify.  Note there is no code to take any action
based on these directives, they're merely tolerated by the lexer and the
parser.  My current thinking is COBOL-WORDS will result in a message indicating
lexing and parsing is likely to fail, when/if I get around to coding some sort
of action.

--2022-05-12--------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified CobolParser.g4 to account for Repository paragraph.  Also added 
actions to collect function names and a sematic predicate to functionName
so a functionCall isn't mistaken for a tableCall.

--2022-04-16--------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified a number of files to account for the inexcusable deprecation of
_all_ of the constructors for Integer.  "Boxing" indeed.

Fixed a bug in CopyReplaceParent.applyReplacingPhrase() that caused
testdata/nist/SM202A to resolve K2SEA incorrectly.  A newline removed
by CopyReplaceParent.subListTerminalNodeWrapper() was not accounted
for properly.

Fixed a bug in CopyReplaceParent.createStringBuilderFromTerminalNodeWrappers()
that caused EXEC CICS ... END-EXEC to have the END-EXEC in the wrong
position and resulted in a parse error.  That code was written prior to the
addition of CICS_TEXT (and SQL_TEXT) in the lexer, and didn't properly
account for differences between those (non-COBOL) formats and the rest of
a COBOL program.

Added some text to Makefile to indicate how to build from scratch.  This was
not something I'd ever had to do and it turned out to be simple, once I
figured out what order to build things.

Renamed CobolPreprocessorParserTerminalNodeListener.java to
PreprocessorParserTerminalNodeListener.java to eliminate problems in building
from scratch.

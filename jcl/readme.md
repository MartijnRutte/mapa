## JCL Parser

This is not intended to be a validating parser, but an analyzing parser; feed it valid JCL and it will allow you to examine its various bits to learn things of interest.

My intent is to provide a mechanism for people to analyze JCL and record pertinent facts in some persistent store.

Currently (12-Jun-2019) a work in progress.

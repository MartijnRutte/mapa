## JCL Parser

This is not intended to be a validating parser, but an analyzing parser; feed it valid JCL and it will allow you to examine its various bits to learn things of interest.

My intent is to provide a mechanism for people to analyze JCL and record pertinent facts in some persistent store.

Currently (25-Sep-2019) a work in progress.  Tests _seem_ to run successfully, and cover everything in the JCL reference except JES3 control statements.  Next step is likely a more robust test rig.
